# fire_or_disease
Ryan Metz - General Assembly Capstone Project
This project will use data on forest fires from the state of New Mexico and the US forestry service to model the spread of fires. To accopmlish this I will utilize the Susceptible-Infected (SI) epidemiology framework - typically applied to predict the spread of infectious diseases.
My theory is that the underlying graph of a human population experiencing an epidemic will be mathematically similar to a forest on fire, with several advantages.
The model uses geospatial arial blocks as nodes. Humans move to different nodes, sometimes over great distances by plane. Trees do not move, which reduces the complexity of the graph somewhat. Additionally, the viruses responsible for diseases mutate constantly. Once a fire develops into a full blown crown fire it does not mutate further.
This project will be concluded at the start of April and results will be presented on April 10th.
